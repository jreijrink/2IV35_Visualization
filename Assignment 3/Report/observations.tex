\section{Observations}\label{sec:observations}

% make interesting observations about the data.
% Document how you came to these observations
% and how the application design was beneficial (or not) to your discoveries.
% Emphasize on interaction aspects, and also
% explain why you think your approach is good from a perceptual point of view

task1 Q1
seems to be that better rating when not part of franchise
HOWEVER, is quantitative, not qualitative
task1 Q2
filter rest axis on internet, then move rating from 0 to 1 to 2. No significant difference
task1 Q3
only possible to see extreme outliers: Regional never got a 2, while coffee, Armenian and Contemporary never get a 0. Also bar/pub only received 2's (1 pub with 5 reviews in total when further investigating)
task1 Q4


task2a Q1
just see that less people in general visit restaurants that are part of franchise
task2a Q2
Seems like it: Jewish people only went to few types of restaurants. HOWEVER, could be that there are only very few jewish consumers. Further investigation (i.e., exploring the map) indeed shows there is only one jewish consumer that visited eight differnet restaurants. Same holds for Mormon. Christian bit more interesting: about 7 consumers that do not visit more than half of the cuisines (including chinese, Armenian, Japanese, Burgers, etc.)


task2b Q1
no real correlation smoker - not permitted
task2b Q2
no record of consumers that drink a lot. only social. But again go to a lot of non-alcoholic restaurants and rate them good
task2b Q3
especially vry few high budget - low price occurrences. But they still rate them weel though (we do need to take quite some exploring to find this out: set pcp, browse map en manually count.
task 2b Q4
yes some do. According to data even someone that rated about ten restaurants far away that transports himself by foot -> can't be right
also: quite some people with a car go to restaurant without parking lot. Does not need to say anything though: may not always go by car
