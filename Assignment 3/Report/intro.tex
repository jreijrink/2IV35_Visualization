\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this report we propose an interactive application for analyzing the restaurant \& consumer data set provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository \cite{WinNT}. However, before we present this application, we explain the contents of this data set (Section \ref{sec:data}), argue for several analysis task that can be performed on this data set (Section \ref{sec:tasks}), and discuss different visualization techniques that can be used in order to achieve these tasks (Section \ref{sec:techniques}). In Section \ref{sec:implemenation} we then present the proposed application and underpin the design decisions that were made. We conclude this report with several observations regarding the application design, in order to draw some final conclusions (Section \ref{sec:observations}).
