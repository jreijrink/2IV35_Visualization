\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this report we analyze the data set \texttt{cities-data.txt}, containing a wide range of information about each one of the different municipalities in The Netherlands. The goal of this project is to properly visualize part of this data in order to formulate answers to some visualization tasks, that we will pose in section~\ref{sec:tasks}. Once the visualization tasks are formulated, we argue on a suitable visualization technique for each of these tasks in section~\ref{sec:techniques}. In section~\ref{sec:observations} we finally describe our observations after implementing the techniques chosen in section~\ref{sec:techniques}.
