\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
In this report we analyze the data set \texttt{cities-data.txt}, containing a wide range of information about the different municipalities of The Netherlands. The goal of this project is to properly visualize part of this data in order to answer a couple of visualization tasks, that we will define in section~\ref{sec:tasks}. Once the visualization tasks are formulated, we argue for suitable visualization techniques for each of these tasks in section~\ref{sec:techniques}. In section~\ref{sec:observations} we finally describe our observations after implementing the techniques that were in chosen in section~\ref{sec:techniques}.
