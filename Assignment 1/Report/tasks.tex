\section{Tasks}

In this section we define the tasks that we would like to perform. That is, we describe what information we would like to retrieve from the given data set. Before we define these tasks we provide a framework (or design space) for formulating specific tasks.

\subsection{Framework for Defining Tasks}
In order to formulate a nice and clear visualization task, we define a framework for doing this as described in \cite{schulz2013design}. Here we distinguish between five different dimensions for each task, namely the \textit{goal} (why is the task pursued), \textit{means} (how is the task carried out), \textit{characteristics}(what does the task seek), \textit{target} (on which part of the data is the task carried out) and \textit{cardinality} (on how many instances is the task carried out). We shortly explain these five aspects in some more detail.

For the goal of the task we distinguish between three different types of analyses. We can have an exploratory analysis (or undirected search) that aims at deriving an hypothesis from an unknown data set, a confirmatory analysis ()

\subsection{Chosen Tasks}
As we now have defined a common framework for formulating visualization tasks, we move on to defining the actual tasks we want to perform on our own data set about the Dutch municipalities. We mainly distinguish between two different task (though the first one has a rather broad character).

\subsubsection{Taks 1}
The first task(s) that we define aims at discovering interesting properties of the given data set, as well as confirming expected properties. This means that this task is actually rather broad, and numerous specific questions can be formulated from it. 

analyze (discover/confirm) relations between attributes
    -> detect outliers
    -> detect data inconsistencies
    -> detect trends
(exploratory|confirmatory, search?, relations|trends|outliers, attr(), all)

compare attribute values of different municipalities
    ->

\todo{specific questions}
Are there municipalities in the Netherlands that suffer from a high degree of an aging population ('vergrijzing' in Dutch).
