\section{Tasks}

In this section we define the tasks that we would like to perform. That is, we describe what information we would like to retrieve from the given data set. Before we define these tasks we provide a framework (or design space) for formulating specific tasks.

\subsection{Framework for Defining Tasks}
In order to formulate a nice and clear visualization task, we define a framework for doing this as described in \cite{schulz2013design}. Here we distinguish between five different dimensions for each task, namely the \textit{goal} (why is the task pusued), \textit{means} (how is the task carried out), \textit{characteristics}(what does the task seek), \textit{target} (on which part of the data is the task carried out) and \textit{cardinality} (on how many instances is the task carried out). We shortly explain these five aspects in some more detail.

For the goal of the task we distinguish between three different types of analyses. We can have an exploratory analysis (or undirected search) that aims at deriving an hypothesis from an unknown data set, a confirmatory analysis ()

\todo{formal description (5-tuple)}
\todo{optional techniques}
parallel coordinates plot, scatterplot matrix, ...
\todo{argueing for chosen technique}

\subsubsection{Taks 2}
\todo{specific questions}
Are there municipalities in the Netherlands that suffer from a high degree of an aging population ('vergrijzing' in Dutch).
\todo{formal description (5-tuple)}
(confirmatory, searching localization, attr(P_65_EO), all)
\todo{optional techniques}
bar chart, normalized bar chart, choropleth map, ...
