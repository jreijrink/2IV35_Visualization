\subsection{techniques for task 1}
Because the tasks 1a and 1b are similar in the sense that they aim at observing quite a lot of different data attributes on a rather high level, we will argue for the use of one general technique for both of these tasks. Techniques that can be chosen for this broad exploration of the data include a Parallel Coordinate Plot (PCP) and Scatterplot Matrix (SM). This is because these two techniques enable us to show a lot of different attributes in one large overview. An advantage of the PCP over the SM is however that the PCP tends to take up less space. Also the axes of the SM tend to become very small when numerous attributes are used. This makes it hard to distinguish between single data objects when analyzing the data. When data objects can be be categorized, this problem can be partly overcome by specifying each category with a certain color. However, for our municipalities data set this categorization is not really possible. An imaginable solution for this would be an interactive SM where the user can zoom in on one of the scatterplots. Unfortunately D3 \cite{D3} does not provide such an example, and implementing it ourselves was considered to consume too much time.
Other visualization techniques such as bar and pie charts, were not considered suitable for these broad overview tasks because they can not really create a nice overview. Different types of hierarchical or network visualizations were quickly disregarded as the data does not posses such structure. Even maps were not deemed very useful, because they make it hard to compare different attribute values with each other. For these reasons, the PCP and SM techniques were chosen to be implemented.

- choropleth map
 - eenvoudig vergelijken
 - moeilijk kleuren onderscheiden

- scatter plot

- sunburst
 - teveel gemeenten
 - geen hierarchische data

- pyramid
 - alleen top 10?
