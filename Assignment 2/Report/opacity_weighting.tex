%% GUIDELINES
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% - Provide details about techniques/methods that you use. Do not just write “We have
%% implemented the marching cubes algorithm”. Describe the method too, in your own
%% words. Even if it is well described in a book, you should still explain the method
%% yourself; this is part of the exercise. Also, the reader may not know the method, nor
%% can the reader be bothered to find the document that you are referring to.
%% - Discuss interesting implementation aspects, but do not include code fragments in the
%% text. Pseudo code is allowed, but mathematical formulas are preferred.
%% - Describe parameters of methods and explain which settings you used and why.
%% - Provide evidence that the method you have implemented actually works as intended.
%% - Explain how you designed a color map, a transfer function, or even your whole visualization
%% approach.
